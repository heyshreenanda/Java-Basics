### 📌 Why This Repo?

I’m using this space to track my learning journey as I build a strong foundation in Java before diving deeper into:

- DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)  
- Full Stack Development  
- Internship/Placement preparation (Google, Amazon, Microsoft)

### 🔧 How to Run the Code

All programs are written in standard Java (`.java`) files.  
You can compile and run them using your preferred IDE (like VS Code or IntelliJ) or from the command line:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
